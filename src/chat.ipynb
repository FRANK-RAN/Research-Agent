      "Owing to their high magnon frequencies, antiferromagnets are key materials for future high-speed spintronics. Picosecond switching of antiferromagnetic spin systems has been viewed a milestone for decades and pursued only by using ultrafast external perturbations. Here, we show that picosecond spin switching occurs spontaneously due to thermal fluctuations in the antiferromagnetic orthoferrite Sm0.7Er0.3FeO3. By analysing the correlation between the pulse-to-pulse polarisation fluctuations of two femtosecond optical probes, we extract the autocorrelation of incoherent magnon fluctuations. We observe a strong enhancement of the magnon fluctuation amplitude and the coherence time around the critical temperature of the spin reorienta...\n",

      "field of sub-cycle quantum optics20–²². Here, we analyse magnon fluctuation dynamics via their temporal autocorrelation function, by measuring the statistical correlations of polarisation noise imprinted on two subsequent femtosecond probe pulses (see Fig. 1a). The two linearly polarised, spectrally separate pulses with a variable time delay Δt are focused on the sample. Upon transmission of the pulses at times t and t + Δt, transient magnetisation fluctuations δMc(t) and δMc(t + Δt) parallel to the propagation direction introduce polarisation changes δα(t) and δα(t + Δt) to each probe, respectively, via the Faraday effect. The polarisation states of the transmitted probe pulses are individually analysed with independent polarimetric detectors. The pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of the detector output are extracted by sub-harmonic lock-in amplification²⁰, multiplied in real time and averaged over ~10⁸ pulses at each delay position. By...\n",

Interestingly, two distinct spectral peaks (purple and green arrows) are observed for most temperatures. The frequencies and amplitudes of both peaks are strongly dependent on temperature. While the two peaks are clearly distinguishable for T ≤ 304 K, they exhibit similar frequencies when approaching the noise enhancement region around TL and eventually become indistinguishable due to the strong broadening. At temperatures T ≫ TL, the spectral amplitude is significantly reduced because of the SRT. Figure 4b shows the frequencies of each peak as a ...\n",

      "proposed concept with coherent excitations is expected to enable the reference. Close to the SRT, the combined effects of magnon softening and thermally induced random switching result in the magnetisation noise not fully decaying to zero within the observation window. In this case, the abovementioned linear baseline subtraction cannot be used without distorting the waveform. From 307.15 K upwards, we therefore use the average baseline of all waveforms recorded below 307.15 K as the reference for our linear baseline subtraction. Furthermore, in the SRT region above 307.15 K, a strong baseline increase is observed, the amplitude of which is strongly temperature dependent and most prominent at around 311 K. The baseline increase is asymmetric around Δt = 0 and therefore must result from external factors, such as a slight misalignment of the delay stage. In the temperature region between 310.35 K and 311.95 K, no signature of correlated noise was observed because of the large asymmetric b...\n",

Subsequently, the signals pass a 20 MHz bandpass filter (BP) and are demodulated at the first sub-harmonic of the laser repetition rate (20 MHz) with a radio-frequency lock-in amplifier (UHFLI, Zurich Instruments)²¹.

An experimentally observable quantity O which is related to the atomic displacements in the crystal can generally be expressed in terms of Qq: O = O(0) + ∑q(∂O/∂Qq)Qq + . . . = O0 + O1 + O2+. . . where the first term O0 = O(0) is the operator O when all Qq’s vanish. An example of an experimentally observable quantity O is the change in the crystal dielectric constant ⎮δϵ due to the atomic displacement produced by the incident electric fields.\\n\\nTo first order in Qq, δϵ = δϵ1 = ⎮ ⎮ h (bq + b−q)eiΨq + (b−q + b†)e−iΨq].\\n\\nHere Ψq is the phase of ∂O/∂Qq = ∂(δϵ)/∂Qq. Indeed, a widely used method to track the phases of coherent phonons in the time-domain [2] is based on the observation of the reflectivity (or transmission) modulation δR (δT) of the sample, which is linearly related to δϵ—the change in the dielectric constant due to lattice vibrations.\\n\\nThe above equation for δϵ indicates that we can define a generalized [10] lattice amplitude operator [8,11]: u (±q) = ⎛b + b† ⎜ eiΨ + ⌈b + b†⌉e−iΨ. This generalized lattice amplitude u (±q) = 2Re{Qq eiΨ} is the underlying microscopic quantity related to an observed reflectivity or transmission modulation when the linear term in Qq, δϵ1, exists. Even if 〈δϵ1〉 vanishes, 〈Δ(δϵ1)2〉 does not.\\n\\nSince different pairs of ±q phonon modes are uncorrelated to one another, the fluctuation of δϵ can be expressed as 〈(Δδϵ)2〉 = ∑ (¯ 1 h/2ωq) |∂(δϵ)/∂Qq| 〈Δu (±q)〉. Here the state is |ψ(t)〉 = U(t)|ψ(0)〉 = ∏ U (t)|ψ (0)〉.\\n\\nIn the CW case, using Eq. (36), the fluctuation is 〈Δu2(±q)〉(cw) = 2{e−2rq cos2(Ωq(t) + φ12/2) + e2rq sin2(Ωq(t) + φ12/2)}, where r = |ζ| = λt/¯q, Ωq(t) = ωqt + π/4, and hereafter 〈. . .〉 denotes an expectation value on squeezed states, unless stated otherwise.\\n\\nTherefore, at certain times, the fluctuation 〈Δu2(±q)〉(cw) can be smaller than 2, which is the vacuum fluctuation level. Furthermore, all the pairs of phonon modes that are driven by the stimulated SORS process share the same frequency: ωq = (ω1 − ω2)/2. Therefore, all the fluctuations 〈Δu2(±q)〉(cw) evolve with the same ωq. Notice that there is no dependence on Ψq in the final expression of 〈Δu2(±q)〉(cw), and the squeezing factor phase φ12 has no q–dependence, all the pairs of modes involved through the SORS share the same phase in their fluctuations.\\n\\nTherefore there can be squeezing in the overall fluctuation 〈(Δδϵ1)2〉(cw).

The Bose–Einstein distribution function approaches the Rayleigh–Jeans distribution function kBT/(ϵ - μ) in this limit. For energies larger than the thermal energy, i.e., ϵ ≫ kBT, we have that nB(ϵ - μ) ≪ 1, so that quantum-mechanical effects cannot be neglected. On the contrary, quantum-many body effects are essential for BEC at finite temperature. Namely, the nature of the high-energy part of the Bose–Einstein distribution function is such that for a given negative chemical potential and temperature there is a certain maximum number of particles that can be accommodated by the states with energy ϵ > 0. Keeping temperature fixed, this number reaches its maximum when μ → 0, at which point BEC occurs. Upon increasing the total number of particles at fixed temperature, the chemical potential thus increases until it becomes zero (measured from the single-particle ground state energy). At this point, the thermal cloud, i.e., the part of the system composed of the particles with energy ϵ > 0, is saturated and all particles that...', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=2334, end_char_idx=4352, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.8659155164572762), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='9a9229a1-26c5-409a-8f2f-e90273fa7e6e', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/frankran/Repos/Research-Chatbot/data/papers/quantum_fluctuation/1-s2.0-S0921452698014835-main.pdf', 'file_name': '1-s2.0-S0921452698014835-main.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 226642, 'creation_date': '2025-03-07', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5a0ee482-8596-4a63-b507-d19ed33cab00', node_type='4', metadata={'file_path': '/Users/frankran/Repos/Research-Chatbot/data/papers/quantum_fluctuation/1-s2.0-S0921452698014835-main.pdf', 'file_name': '1-s2.0-S0921452698014835-main.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 226642, 'creation_date': '2025-03-07', 'last_modified_date': '2025-03-07'}, hash='fd19a30f4d54abcb173792bffd9978e78bab840df6942bd0be68ab4497a13625')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='X.
